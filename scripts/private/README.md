## Firebase Setup
In order to run Firebase commands from the release script, you need to have a valid Firebase token with write access in your environment. To do so, add the following to your bash file (~/.local.bash):
`export FIREBASE_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE`

*If you need a token, please contact your Firebase administrator to get one.*

### Firebase Admin Instructions
Tokens are generated by running the following command:
`firebase login:ci`

This open a browser window, have you login, then will yield a token with the same rights as the account you authenticated. Be sure not to lose this token as you will need it to revoke access!

To revoke access for a particular token, run:
`firebase logout --token TOKEN_TO_REVOKE`
